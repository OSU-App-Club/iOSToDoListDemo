# iOS To-Do List
This is a guide intended to get you up and running with iOS development.  

#### Before we begin
Install Xcode from the App Store. Make sure it's up to date by searching for it in the App Store and going to its page.

#### Creating a project in Xcode
Open Xcode. If you see the *Welcome to Xcode* screen, you can click *Create a new Xcode project*.  
You can also click the File menu at the top, then select New -> Project.

Next, you'll be prompted to choose a template. Under the iOS Application section, choose the *Single View Application* template.  
Enter a descriptive Product Name like ToDoList. The Organization Name and Organization Identifier can be left at their defaults.  
For Language, select Swift.  
For Devices, select Universal.  
Uncheck *Use Core Data*, *Include Unit Tests*, and *Include UI Tests*

#### Finding your way around
You've just created a new project. There are a few files you should know about in here.

1. Main.storyboard is where you'll create your user interface.
2. ViewController.swift and other files ending in .swift contain your application's logic.
